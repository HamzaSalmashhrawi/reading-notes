# HTML5 Layout
* HTML5 layout elements
* How old browsers understand new elements
* Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS

#### HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find it easier to understand how they can be used now that you have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These new elements are going to play an important part in creating layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
* The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
* How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
* How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
